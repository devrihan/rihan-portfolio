As a Backend Engineer intern at East Coast Railways, I was responsible for developing and enhancing a Complaint Management System (CMS) tailored for internal use by railway employees. My role involved collaborating with senior IT engineers to build and maintain server-side logic, ensuring efficient data processing, and secure API integrations. I utilized technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to develop robust backend functionalities, and implemented bcrypt for secure password hashing and multer for file handling. This internship provided valuable experience in troubleshooting system issues, enhancing digital infrastructure, and improving operational efficiency within a large organizational framework.
